# You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:
def myFunction() :
  return True

print(myFunction())

# You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:
def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")
  
# Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, 
# like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object 
# is of a certain data type
x = 200
